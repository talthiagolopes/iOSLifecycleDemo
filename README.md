This is my first fork that I have done in order to learn a little bit more all about forking a repo here in GitHub. You can check more details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) 

If you are studying iOS + Swift or would like to know more about the ViewController lifecycle. I really invite you to take a look running this app in order to understand and be using it correctly.
